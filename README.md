# Bubble Sort

The project includes the bubble sort algorithm written in C as three
distinct functions:
- *bubblesort* - Carries out the bubble sort algorithm by calling function
*bubblepass* the required number of times.
- *bubblepass* - Carries out a single bubble pass, examining each pair of
adjacent elements of the array and swapping them if not in order.
- *swap* - Receives two pointers to *int*'s and swaps their values.

For this exercise, replace the three C functions mentioned above with
assembly implementations.
